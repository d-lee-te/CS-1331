# CS 1331 - Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (Fall 2020)
I took CS 1331 @ Gatech in the Fall of 2020.

Lectured by Suzy Watson.

## About
I'm having trouble finding an active link to the Syllabus that's working, so I'll give a brief synopsis of the syllabus.

This class was taught using Java and JavaFX for the GUI portion of assignments.

### Course Curriculum
1. Understand object-oriented programming principles and apply them in the construction of Java programs.
2. Demonstrate proficiency in writing medium sized (1-10 source file) Java programs.
3. Create, select, and use appropriate basic algorithms and data structures in Java programs.
4. Understand and apply event-driven programming principles in graphical user interface (GUI) programs.

### Assignments
1. Classes - Encapulsation, object equality, and **this** keyword usage
2. Inheritence and Hierarchies - **Super** keyword usage, **private** keyword usage, and constructors
3. Abstract vs Interface classes
4. Comparable Interface - Implenting Comparable interface, 2 sorting algorithms, and 2 search algorithms
5. File I/O - Searching and manipulating files using File I/O and writing/throwing/handling exceptions
6. Practice - Practice of the skills learned above and use of the **instanceof** operator
7. JavaFX GUI - Design and create a GUI using JavaFX
8. Common Datastructures - Create List, Stack, and LinkedList data structures w/o the imported classes

### Debrief
If I remember correctly, this is actually the second-level CS class I took. I took the equivalent of CS 1301 4x over high school (twice), my brief time at Georgia State (also twice).

With that said, I believe this was my first time really getting to work with Java despite having "used" it for 2 years prior. 
This class was extremely useful in bringing me exposure to the capabilities of Java and how I should design my code based on the assignment offered. 
Adding to that, this class was a lot of "firsts" for me.

It was the first time:
- Working with the Interface class and using **super**
- Using File I/O operations in any language
- Working with an imported library
- Searching through documentation
- Building and understanding new datastructures
- Building and understanding new search and sort algorithms
- Building a GUI (Graphical User Interface)

I didn't enjoy the pace at which the class proceeded, but it was an extremely efficient introduction to how classes at Tech would be structured in terms of pace and workload.

Adding to that, regarding my time using Java before this class, I take responsibility for not having earlier exposure to most of what this class covered prior to the attendance of this class.

# Disclaimer
As most of the course content belongs to either the College or the Professors, I am transcribing my work and assignments to record the course.

As such, many assignments and files **may not include detailed descriptions or solutions**. This is done to avoid violations, avoid doxing myself and others, and any number of other reasons. If for any reason the full repo must be accessed, all assignments, descriptions, solutions, and class files are stored in a private version of the repo (so contact me. If you're a current student, don't bother since I won't give you access and it wouldn't help you anyway xp).

If possible, portions of the class will be linked to a separate readme explaining more about the linked assignment/solution/description/other.

If there exist any honorcode violations or any problems/solutions are *too* in-depth, please contact me. The intention of each public class repo is to record my experience and assignments of each class taken.
