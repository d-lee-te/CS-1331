## About
I'm having trouble finding an active link to the Syllabus that's working, so I'll give a brief synopsis of the syllabus.

I took CS 1331 @ Gatech in the Fall of 2020.

This class was taught using Java and JavaFX for the GUI portion of assignments.

### Course Curriculum
1. Understand object-oriented programming principles and apply them in the construction of Java programs.
2. Demonstrate proficiency in writing medium sized (1-10 source file) Java programs.
3. Create, select, and use appropriate basic algorithms and data structures in Java programs.
4. Understand and apply event-driven programming principles in graphical user interface (GUI) programs.

### Assignments
1. Classes - Encapulsation, object equality, and **this** keyword usage\
2. Inheritence and Hierarchies - **Super** keyword usage, **private** keyword usage, and constructors
3. Abstract vs Interface classes
4. Comparable Interface - Implenting Comparable interface, 2 sorting algorithms, and 2 search algorithms
5. File I/O - Searching and manipulating files using File I/O and writing/throwing/handling exceptions
6. Practice - Practice of the skills learned above and use of the **instanceof** operator
7. JavaFX GUI - Design and create a GUI using JavaFX
8. Common Datastructures - Create List, Stack, and LinkedList data structures w/o the imported classes

## Disclaimer
As most of the course content belongs to either the College or the Professors, I am transcribing my work and assignments to record the course.

As such, many assignments **may not include detailed descriptions or solutions**. All assignments, descriptions, solutions, and class files are stored in a privated version of the repo.

The intention of each public class repo is to record my experience and assignments of each class taken.

If there exist any honorcode violations or any problems/solutions are in-depth, please contact me.
